To test the User Interface, RUN DEMO.JAVA located in the UserLogin package. Upon doing so, you will be prompted
to input a valid email address and a password (existing accounts of different roles, i.e. Speakers, Organizers, and 
Attendees, can be found in Users.csv, located in the Resources package). If the email and password combination cannot 
be found, the program will prompt you to try again. 

Email addresses and passwords of each account are located in the fourth and third columns of Users.csv, respectively.

Once logged in, there are several actions that can be taken with the account (view talk schedules, send messages, log 
out, etc.). To test these actions, input the number corresponding to the function you would like to test.
From there, follow the prompts to test different functionality within the program. Any changes made to the account,
(any messages sent, new events signed up for, etc.) will be updated in categorized CSV files at the time of logging
out of the program. You may navigate back to the main menu in order to switch "screens" at any time, and you
can only log out from the main menu. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU LOG OUT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE
DURING THE TEST.

Functionality will vary depending on whether the logged in User is a Speaker, Attendee, or Organizer.
