To test the user interface, RUN DEMO.JAVA located in the UserLogin package as done in Phase 1. You will be 
prompted to input a valid email address and a password. Existing users and their log in credentials are 
stored in Users.json in the Resources package. If the inputted credentials do not match any existing user, you will be prompted to try again.

Passwords and email addresses of each user are located in the third and fourth columns, respectively, of 
Users.csv.

Once logged in, a main menu will be presented, where there are several options to choose from (to view 
messages, scheduling, or to log out). Just like in Phase 1, input the index corresponding to the function
you would like to test; whatever actions you perform (including messages sent, events signed up for, etc.)
will be saved to several categorized JSON files once the account is LOGGED OUT OF THE PROGRAM. 

Functionality will vary based on the type of user account logged in: Speaker, Organizer, or Attendee. The 
type of each user is specified in the first column of Users.csv, which you can refer to if you would like 
to test a specific type of user account.
