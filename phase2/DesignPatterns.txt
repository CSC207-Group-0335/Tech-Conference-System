List of Design Patterns Used:

Observer:

The Observer pattern was used in this program to keep track of changes in an object.
These following classes implement Observable:

- MessagingSystem: notifies observers when a MessengerController has been set

- EventSystem: notifies observers when an OrgScheduleController, UserScheduleController, 
  or SpeakerScheduleController has been set.

- RoomSystem: runs EventSystem, which uses Observer

- LogInController: notifies observers of what type of User has logged in
