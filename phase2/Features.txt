Features Added:

- Group Chats which are chatrooms for each event

- Message statuses; allows users to archive, mark as unread/read,
  or delete messages.

-Allows seeing schedule by speaker, day or enrolled events

- Allows users to send in requests or accommodations 

- Stores information inside JSON files

Our implementation of message statuses is very extensible and open for modification too as the type of status is
not constrained by individual instance variables, but rather an arbitrary long list of statuses.
