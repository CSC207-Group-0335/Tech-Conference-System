Dependency Inversion:
To follow clean architecture, we donâ€™t want classes in outer layers to directly handle classes and objects of inner layers.
This was a major reason for architectural violations in Phase 1 of our project and we implemented a layer of abstraction to
resolve this issue. Where once entity classes were directly being handled inside our controller classes, we introduced new
abstractions and use case classes that handled the logic that was previously in controllers and passed the final actionable
input back into the controllers. For example, the abstract MessageController class now makes calls to the MessageManager use
case class to obtain formatted strings of messages apart from the message entities themselves, as well as handling logic
such as changing user statuses.
